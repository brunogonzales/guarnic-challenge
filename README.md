## Guarnic's challenge

### Requirements

- Node > v10

### Instructions

Run `yarn after-30-days` to print the products after 30 days.

Run `yarn test` to run the tests

Run `yarn coverage` to see the test coverage report (~10% atm)

Note: There is a small discrepancy from the sample .txt file of the challenge because the starting index of the printing loop is now `1` pointing out that we should start updating the products after the first day has passed.
